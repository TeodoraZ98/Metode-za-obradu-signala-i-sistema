## LZW Compression – Signal Processing Project

This project demonstrates the use of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm for lossless data compression and decompression. It was developed as part of a signal processing elective course. The project includes a Python implementation of the LZW algorithm, a compiled `.exe` version, and sample text and binary files to test compression performance.

## Features

- Compresses text files using LZW algorithm
- Supports decompression of previously encoded files
- Includes encoded/decoded examples and chatbot use case
- Exportable Python and executable format
- Optional GUI icon and visuals

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter (GUI)
- PyInstaller (for `.exe` build)
- Standard Python libraries (file handling, string operations)

## Project Structure

- LZW_Compression.py – main compression/decompression script
- LZW_Compression.exe – compiled Windows executable
- sample.txt – input example
- sampleEncoded.txt / sampleDecoded.txt – encoded and decoded outputs
- chatbotcase.pdf / chatbotcase_Encoded.txt – real-world compression use case
- Kompresija-podataka-primenom-LZW.docx – academic documentation (in Serbian)

## How to Run

1. Run via Python:
   python LZW_Compression.py

2. Or double-click `LZW_Compression.exe` (Windows only)

3. Follow prompts to encode or decode a file.
